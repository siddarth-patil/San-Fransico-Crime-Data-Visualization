# San-Fransico-Crime-Data-Visualization

## Description:
Unfortunately, the occurrence of crime is a part of everyones’ life. Various techniques have been used to understand about these crimes and come up with solutions which would increase the safety of the citizens. But, another way of understanding the data is through the perspective of the police department itself. The visualizations showed that the department was the busiest on Fridays as most of the incidents were reported on Fridays. Further Southern, Mission and Northern Police Districts got the highest number of cases reported to. Finally over the period of time the most reported crimes were Theft, Vandalism and Burglary. Therefore assuming that the available data is accurate we can conclude that more officers should be working for the Southern police district. Also, the number of people in Friday’s shift should be highest and a better plan should be used to reduce the top committed crimes around the city.
